%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
\documentclass[3p,times]{elsarticle} %this is original one for 1 column
%\documentclass[5p,times,twocolumn]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
%\usepackage{ecrc}

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
%\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
%\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
%\journalname{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
%\runauth{M. Z. Alam et al.}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
%\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
%\jnltitlelogo{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using TeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% End of ecrc-specific commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{amsmath}

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.
\usepackage{lineno}

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting
%%
%% \biboptions{comma,round}

% \biboptions{}

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic, algorithm}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% add words to TeX's hyphenation exception list
%\hyphenation{author another created financial paper re-commend-ed Post-Script}

% correct bad hyphenation here

		\begin{abstract}
			Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are getting significant attention in recent years for their role and impact on the improvement in quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness in the context of healthcare. Advanced data analytics enabled CDSS are found to perform more accurately and timely than traditional systems. In this domain, survival prediction or deterioration prediction of critical cared patients, such as intensive care unit (ICU) patients, is an active research area. Early deterioration prediction can help health care providers to take proper and timely actions for the patients. The research works in this area are mostly based on the vital signs. Very few studies are available on survival prediction using lab tests data. Although some research works have made some advancement in this area, the accuracy is still suffering and is not satisfactory. \textcolor{blue}{Hence, the main goal of the current research work is to provide a technique to improve the accuracy and efficiency of survival prediction using lab test data.} We propose a feature ranking based ensemble of classifiers for survival prediction of ICU patients using lab test data. In the proposed approach, features are evaluated first and subsets of `useful' features are selected. Subsequently, training data with the selected features are clustered using a novel feature vector compaction (FVC) technique. Finally, ensemble classifier models are trained. Extensive experiments in more than 3000 different settings on 6 datasets of ICU patients have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of our approach. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique outperforms other approaches.
