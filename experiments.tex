\section{Experiments}\label{s:experiments}
All experiments have been conducted on a CPU with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U (@ 2.50 GHz) having 8 GB RAM and running Windows 10 operating system. For applying various ranker algorithms, Weka 3.9 \cite{weka} has been used. We evaluate the performance of the models using F-score. F-score is a popular and reliable metric that is widely used in the literature. In fact we report the weighted average F-score in the range of [0,1] ($F_{wa}$) which is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
F_{WA} = \frac{F_{Alive} * Count_{Alive} +  F_{Dead} * Count_{Dead}}{Count_{Alive} + Count_{Dead}}
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Feature sets for MIMIC-II and MIMIC-III}
\textcolor{blue}{For MIMIC-II datasets, 655 lab tests are identified and these are treated as feature sets for the experiments on MIMIC-II datasets. On the other hand, 570 lab tests are collected and these are used for the experiments on MIMIC-III datasets. The detail list of these lab tests are available int the supplementary file.}
 
\subsection{Notations/Definitions used to represent the results}

\subsection{Experiments with variations}
For each dataset, multiple ensemble models are created. In particular, for each dataset, 4 separate subsets of high ranked features, produced by 4 different feature ranking algorithms, are combined with four combinations of feature vector grouping, namely, HV (i.e., ORCU-HV), H (i.e., Horizontal), VH (i.e., ORCU-VH), V (i.e., Vertical). Thus a number of models with different combinations are constructed. We refer to these models using the following form: Model$_{<i>}^{<datasetID-combination>}, 1\leq i \leq 572$. Figure \ref{F:ModelGenOverview} shows how these 572 models are generated for each dataset. For example, Model$_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{AF-R1HVCJ48}$ refers to the model where (a) Adult Binary (F) dataset is used for training \& testing; (b) $1_{st}$ subset of the ranked features (i.e., R1) are used after applying a ranking algorithm; (c) \textit{Horizontal} feature vector compaction has been applied; (d) Vacuum count has been used and (e) J48 has been employed as the classifier algorithm.

So, all considered approaches are listed in Table \ref{t:competingmodels}. Additionally, we have constructed the baseline model using all the features, i.e., ignoring the feature ranking exercise; this model is referred to as Model$_{Base}^{<datasetID>}$.
